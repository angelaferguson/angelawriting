    <h1 id="tips-for-a-successful-tech-review">Tips for a successful tech review</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been working really hard on documenting that new feature, and your docs are almost ready for publishing. You&rsquo;ve been fortunate (this time!) to have a realistic timeline, and you&rsquo;ve been able to get your draft done more than a week before publishing date!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one thing you still need to do.</p>
<p><em>Tech Review Request</em></p>
<p>Technical review is your chance to get your content in front of the eyeballs of your subject matter experts, or SMEs. They might be developers, product managers, marketing folks, or any number of other people from yours or other departments in your company. The idea is for them to read through your draft content and make sure that it&rsquo;s accurate and complete.</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, your SMEs are enthusiastic about documentation. These doc advocates will zip through your content, and provide comprehensive comments about what works and what can be improved. I&rsquo;ve worked with many SMEs like this, and I&rsquo;m always so grateful to have them in my corner. After all, it works to all of our advantage if the content we&rsquo;re putting in front of our users is <em>actually correct</em>, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not always that easy. As technical writers, I think we have all experienced this frustrating situation. You&rsquo;ve worked hard to document that new feature. You&rsquo;ve finished way ahead of deadline, with plenty of time for your SMEs to review your work for accuracy. And that&rsquo;s lucky because there were a couple of small things you weren&rsquo;t 100% sure about in the docs.</p>
<p>You send your content with an accompanying message <em>begging</em> for feedback - something, anything - before publishing day. You might even ask one or two questions right in the email, to make sure everyone knows that there are some open queries.</p>
<p>You wait.</p>
<p><em>Crickets</em></p>
<p>You run into Marnie the product manager in the office kitchen. &ldquo;Hey, how&rsquo;s that review going?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ohhhh sorry! I&rsquo;ve been super busy. Will look at it tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With two days until publishing, still&hellip;<em>crickets</em>. You send off another message, this one more urgent than the last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need your input by tomorrow or else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you find  yourself in this situation, it&rsquo;s often too late by this stage to get a good review at all. Now your SMEs don&rsquo;t have enough time to really read your content thoroughly, and meanwhile your time is ticking. If there are any major problems with what you&rsquo;ve written, you&rsquo;re probably going to have to do your best to cram in the changes. At best, you&rsquo;ll get it all done in time. at worst, you&rsquo;ll have to try your best, and iterate on it for the next doc release.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve all been there. I wanted to write a few of my own tried-and-true tips for making sure you get feedback, meaningful feedback, with enough time to actually implement it.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not totally naive. I know that it can seem like somewhat of a luxury to have enough time to get your work done early enough for this process to work. But that&rsquo;s a whole separate issue, and I think that if you regularly find that you don&rsquo;t have enough time for a good tech review, then you need to take a look at some of your work processes and see how you could make some time. But I&rsquo;m going to pretend for the sake of these tips that we&rsquo;re working optimally here, with a bit of time between first draft and publish date.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-a-productive-tech-review-process">Tips for a productive tech review process</h2>
<p>These are a few guidelines I try to follow with my tech review requests. My SMEs generally tend to be pretty responsive. After all, people usually have the best intentions of helping, but if you don&rsquo;t present your requests in the right way, they can go pretty low down on the priority list.</p>
<h3 id="give-a-deadline-thats-enough-time-but-not-too-much-time">Give a deadline that&rsquo;s <em>enough</em> time, but not <em>too much</em> time</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re all busy. Our SMEs are busy. As technical writers, we live and breathe documentation, and it&rsquo;s usually the top priority for our jobs. But that product manager might have to present the product roadmap for the coming quarter this week. The developer might be fixing a major bug that has appeared in the very feature you&rsquo;re writing about. Reading some dry documentation about a new feature they put to bed several weeks ago will probably slip further and further down the priority list.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to give them two weeks for the review.</p>
<p>Giving a deadline is a given.</p>
<h3 id="point-out-how-the-review-helps-them">Point out how the review helps them</h3>
<p>I think it can feel like the review is only going to benefit the technical writer. But the truth is, if the content can be improved in any way, it&rsquo;s likely to be a benefit to the people who are doing the reviewing, too.</p>
<p>Is your SME a product owner? Well, their review and help with improving your content could help more customers to understand and use their beloved new feature more effectively.</p>
<p>Is your SME in a client-facing position? Well, they probably have a good understanding of what the client needs and how to talk to them. They will most likely be sharing your content with clients, and it will be all the better for them in the long run if they help you now with a review!</p>
<p>Make sure you mention in your review request the ways that the review will be helping your reviewers, too. Don&rsquo;t forget that the purpose is not only to help you do your job, but also to help get the word out to clients and support them.</p>
<h3 id="ask-a-few-smes-but-not-too-many">Ask a few SMEs, but not too many</h3>
<p>You send your request to 12 people. You&rsquo;ve got product folks, some people from support, and implementations. They&rsquo;ll all have different angles and, combined, they&rsquo;ll provide great reviews, right?</p>
<p>But what often ends up happening, I find, is that each of those people looks at the &ldquo;To&rdquo; list and thinks, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too busy this week. One of those other 9 can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think this really can happen with tech reviews, which can sometimes not feel like the reviewers&rsquo; top priority. They might think it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s job, or that someone else will have time when they don&rsquo;t. But if everyone thinks that way, then who is going to reply?</p>
<p>I find a more effective strategy is to ask a smaller group of people. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll break up my content and send smaller sections to different people, so that everybody just has a small section to review. This divide-and-conquer approach mainly works if you have content that can be easily and neatly divided up.</p>
<p>But in the end, I often find that I get a better response if I send out my review request to fewer than 5 people, rather than a larger group. Plus, if you get lucky and everybody <em>does</em> respond with super-awesome feedback, 5 people&rsquo;s comments will be a lot less overwhelming than 12!</p>
<h3 id="send-smaller-documents-more-often">Send smaller documents, more often</h3>
<p>This one sort of ties in with a couple of the points I&rsquo;ve already mentioned. Again, SMEs are busy. We know they have a tendency to put off tech review requests until the last minute. They probably don&rsquo;t even open the files until the day before your (but too soon but soon enough!) deadline.</p>
<p>Now, if the content you&rsquo;ve sent is 60 pages long, that&rsquo;s going to feel a bit intimidating once they do open up that file or go to the link.</p>
<p>What will happen next time you send a review request? Your SMEs are immediately going to have flashbacks to that last time when they had to work back until 8pm to review your mega load of content, and they&rsquo;re going to start sweating and probably put it off all over again. Maybe not even respond.</p>
<p>You want to make it an easy and pleasant experience for your reviewers. I think the better way to achieve this is to send smaller chunks of content more often. This will help to prevent that overwhelming experience of having to review 60 pages of content all at once, and at the same time, it will make reviews a more regular part of their weekly job, rather than an infrequent but horrible thing they have to go through each month.</p>
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what my tech review process looks like. I try to make sure I send out some content every two weeks. I give a one-week deadline for its return. This allows for follow-up during the second week when the first deadline blows by with no replies (it happens!). I send to groups of, at most, 5 or 6 reviewers at a time, but ideally more like 2 or 3. That way, we avoid the &ldquo;somebody else will do it&rdquo; situation as well as the overwhelming amounts of feedback and comments for me.</p>
